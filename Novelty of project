The novelty of the proposed method is listed as follows.
(i)	The first novelty of the proposed method is that the hand gesture recognition is based on the result of finger recognition. Therefore, the recognition is accomplished by a simple and efficient rule instead of the sophisticated but complicated classifiers such as SVM and CRF.
(ii) The second advantage of the proposed method is that it is highly efficient and fit for real-time applications.
